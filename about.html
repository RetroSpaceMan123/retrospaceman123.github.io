        <p>Hello! My name is Carlos. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Florida. I have earned an Associate's of Arts from Santa Fe College, and I just earned a Bachelor's of Science from the College of Engineering at the University of Florida.</p>
        <p>Although I have been programming since my childhood, I started consistently programming in 2018 with the creation of my first Discord bot. Since then I have had the privilege to work on a series of projects both on my own and with a team.</p>
        <p>I have also completed an internship at Miami-Dade County ITD during the summer of 2023, which taught me how software engineers operate in a real-world setting.</p>
        <p>I am currently looking for a full-time position for a software engineer to start working in a field I feel passionate about.</p>
