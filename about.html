        <p>Hello! My name is Carlos. I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I have earned an Associate's of Arts from Santa Fe College, and I am currently working towards a Bachelor's of Science from the College of Engineering.</p>
        <p>Although I have been programming since my childhood, I started consistently programming in 2018 with the creation of my first Discord bot. Since then I have had the privilege to work on a series of projects both on my own and with a team.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm interning with the Miami Dade IT Department to learn about how software engineering is applied in a real world setting. Once this internship ends, I'll be focusing on completeing my Bachelor's degree as soon as possible.</p>
